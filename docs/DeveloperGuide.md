### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The user interface (UI) of the system is composed of a `MainWindow` that is made up of various parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities among classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands by interacting with the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data and updates the UI with the modified data accordingly.
- holds a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- relies on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Event` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Event` (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object) objects .
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects, similar to how the currently 'selected' `Person` objects are stored and updated. It is stored as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>`.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented] Add event feature

#### Current Implementation

Adding an event is a feature that uses the command `addevent ev/EVENT_NAME from/EVENT_START_DATE_TIME to/EVENT_END_DATE_TIME`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add event operation works.

![AddEventSequenceDiagram](images/AddEventSequenceDiagram.png)

This operation is similar to that of adding a person. Adding an event involves calling `Model#addEvent(Event)`, which in turn calls `AddressBook#addEvent(Event)` to add the Event object to the existing `AddressBook`.

### \[Implemented] Find event feature

#### Current Implementation

Finding an event is a feature that uses the command `findevent [EVENT_NAME]`. The implementation of `findevent` is similar to the `find` implementation but specific to events.
Below is the sequence diagram detailing how the `findevent` operation works.

![FindEventSequenceDiagram](images/FindEventSequenceDiagram.png)

Following the same initial steps of parsing commands, searching for an event involves further parsing the keywords into a `EventNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.
This `EventNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is used to instantiate a `FindEventCommand` object.
The `FindEventCommand` object is then executed in `LogicManager#execute` through `FindEventCommand#execute` which returns the output of the command.

### \[Implemented] Delete event feature

#### Current Implementation

Deleting an event is a feature that uses the command `delevent [EVENT_INDEX]`. The following sequence diagram shows how the delete event operation works.

![DelEventSequenceDiagram](images/DelEventSequenceDiagram.png)

This operation is similar to that of deleting a person. Deleting an event involves calling `Model#deleteEvent(1)`, which in turn calls `AddressBook#deleteEvent(1)` to delete the event at index `1` in the `AddressBook`.

Additionally, this operation involves searching through all `Person` objects in the `AddressBook` and deleting the event at index `1`. This is done by calling `Model#deleteEventFromPersonList(1)`, which in turn calls `AddressBook#deleteEventFromPersonList(1)`.

The `deleteEventFromPersonList` method will check through the full list of `Person` objects (i.e., not just the filtered list on display) in order to completely remove the specified event from the `AddressBook`.

### \[Implemented] Sort events feature

#### Current Implementation

Sorting a list of events is a feature that uses the command `sortevent a/b/c/d`.
The events can be sorted based on their:
- names in ascending ASCII order (using `sortevent a`)
- names in descending ASCII order (using `sortevent b`)
- start date times in ascending order (using `sortevent c`)
- end date times in ascending order (using `sortevent d`)

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort events operation works.

![SortEventSequenceDiagram](images/SortEventSequenceDiagram.png)

Sorting a list of events involves calling `Model#sortEventList(SortEventType)`, which will sort the event list based on the `SortEventType` object passed into the method.

This sorting feature can only be executed when there are more than 1 event listed on the UI.
It will only sort the event list based on the last String entered in the user input.

### \[Implemented] List persons from an event feature

#### Current Implementation

Listing persons from an event is a feature that uses the command `listevcontact [EVENT_INDEX]`. The following sequence diagram shows how the listing of persons from an event works.

![ListEvContactSequenceDiagram](images/ListEvContactSequenceDiagram.png)

The `listevcontact` constructs an `EventSetContainsEventPredicate` object first, then executes `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(EventSetContainsEventPredicate)` to update the list according to the predicate to list of persons whose event set contain the specified event.

The `EventSetContainsEventPredicate` object is created in `ListEvContactCommand` instead of `ListEvContactCommandParser` because the `EventSetContainsEventPredicate` object needs to take in the specified `Event` which can only be referenced by the `EVENT_INDEX` in `ListEvContactCommand` class.
